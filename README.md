matrigato's build of dwm
============================

dwm - dynamic window manager
------------
[dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit [config.mk](config.mk) to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

	make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

	exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

	DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

	while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
	do
		sleep 1
	done &
	exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.

FAQ
------------
> What are the bindings?

This is suckless, the source code is the documentation. Check out [config.h](config.h).

> Wait, if I change the configuration by editing the source code and recompiling, does that mean I need to close all my applications and quit the graphical environment to reload it and make the changes take effect?

Yes, but actually no. You can start dwm in a _while_ loop to reload it while not destroying other X windows.

For example, if you use the following code (taken from the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dwm)) instead of just using `exec dwm` in your .xinitrc, quitting dwm will reload it if the executable has been rebuilt.

	# relaunch DWM if the binary changes, otherwise bail
	csum=""
	new_csum=$(sha1sum $(which dwm))
	while true
	do
		if [ "$csum" != "$new_csum" ]
		then
			csum=$new_csum
			dwm
		else
			exit 0
		fi
		new_csum=$(sha1sum $(which dwm))
		sleep 0.5
	done
